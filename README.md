# Census samples come from the same distribution? Logistic Regression model creation.
These are two census samples.

Goals:

**1. Know if the samples come from the same distribution or are independent.**

1.1. Bootsrapping

1.2. Boxplots

1.3. Histograms

1.4. Relative frequency graphs

1.5. Dispersion and position measurements

1.5.1. Variation of the Pearson coefficient

1.6. Skewness and kurtosis

1.7. Nonparametric statistics

1.7.1. Mann-Whitney U rank test

1.7.2. Chi-squared goodness-of-fit test

**2. Exploratory analysis**

2.1. One-dimensional analysis

2.2. Multidimensional analysis

2.3. Group the unique values that do not exceed 2.5% of the relative frequency of the variable with other values.

2.4. Correlations and associations

2.4.1. Chi-squared test of independence

**3. Logistic regression**

**4. Confusion matrix**
