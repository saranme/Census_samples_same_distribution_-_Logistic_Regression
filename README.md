# Census samples come from the same distribution? Logistic Regression model creation.
These are two census samples.

Goals:
1. Know if the samples come from the same distribution or are independent.
1.1. Bootsrapping
1.2. Boxplots
1.3. Histograms
1.4. Relative frequency graphs
1.5. Dispersion and position measurements
1.5.1. Variation of the Pearson coefficient
1.6. Skewness and kurtosis
1.7. Nonparametric statistics
1.7.1. Mann-Whitney U rank test
1.7.2. Chi-squared goodness-of-fit test

3. Exploratory analysis
3.1. One-dimensional analysis
3.2. Multidimensional analysis
3.3. Group the unique values that do not exceed 2.5% of the relative frequency of the variable with other values.
3.4. Correlations and associations
3.4.1. Chi-squared test of independence

4. Logistic regression
5. Confusion matrix
